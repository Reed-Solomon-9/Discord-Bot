This is a discord application for actualizing a feature in my fantasy football league. The league voted on a feature where the worst trade offers of the week would be voted on by a rotating council.

The bot is used to facilitate this voting in Discord. It has the following functions:

-automatically adds and removes the appropriate group members to a private Discord thread in my server. This thread has a rotating group of three people who vote on bad trades.

-moves photos (usually screen captures of the trade offers) automatically from the general thread to the private thread where they are only visible to voters

-generates a poll when a photo enters the private thread that prompts the members for a simple yes or no vote
